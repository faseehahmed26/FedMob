## FedMob: NVIDIA FLARE + React Native Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mobile Client Foundation (Sept 8 - Sept 24)
**Objective:** Build React Native client with FLARE web gateway integration

**Key Tasks:**
- Set up React Native app with TensorFlow.js integration
- Implement HTTPS communication with FLARE web gateways
- Create device registration and authentication flow
- Build basic model receive/send functionality via HTTP requests
- Test client connection to FLARE leaf nodes

**Deliverable:** React Native app successfully connecting to FLARE web gateway with basic FL communication

### Phase 2: FLARE Server & Web Gateway Setup (Sept 24 - Oct 20)
**Objective:** Deploy production FLARE infrastructure with mobile support

**Key Tasks:**
- Replace existing Flask server with NVIDIA FLARE server
- Configure FLARE hierarchical architecture (Server → Aggregators → Leaf Nodes)
- Deploy web gateways for mobile device connectivity
- Implement FedAvg algorithm within FLARE framework
- Establish secure HTTPS communication pipeline
- Test multi-client coordination through web gateways

**Deliverable:** Complete FLARE server infrastructure supporting mobile clients via web gateways

### Phase 3: Training Pipeline & Production Optimization (Oct 20 - Nov 17)
**Objective:** End-to-end federated learning with performance optimization

**Key Tasks:**
- Implement on-device training with TensorFlow.js
- Create model serialization/deserialization for web transport
- Build federated learning orchestration (FedAvg rounds)
- Add performance monitoring and resource management
- Implement multiple model types (CNN, lightweight transformers)
- Scale testing with multiple React Native clients

**Deliverable:** Production-ready federated learning system with React Native clients

### Critical Milestones:
- **Standup 1:** React Native client communicating with FLARE web gateway
- **Standup 2:** Multi-client federated learning rounds completing successfully
- **Standup 3:** Optimized system supporting multiple model architectures
- **Final Demo:** Scalable mobile federated learning application

### Key Architecture Change:
```
Original: React Native → Custom gRPC Bridge → Flower Server
Updated: React Native → HTTPS → FLARE Web Gateway → FLARE Server
```

This approach leverages FLARE's built-in mobile support infrastructure, eliminating the need for custom protocol bridges while providing enterprise-grade federated learning capabilities.
