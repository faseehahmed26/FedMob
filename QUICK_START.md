# ðŸš€ FedMob Quick Start Guide

## Ready to Test with 2 Mobile Phones!

### Step 1: Start the Server (Laptop)
```bash
cd flower-server
python test_network.py  # Test network first
python start_with_proxy.py  # Start server with gRPC-Web proxy
```

**Note the IP address displayed** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### Step 2: Start Mobile Apps (2 Phones)
```bash
cd MobileClient
npx expo start
```

**On each phone:**
1. Open the FedMob app
2. Enter server address: `YOUR_LAPTOP_IP:8081`
3. Tap "Connect to Server"
4. Wait for "Connected" status

### Step 3: Start Federated Learning
1. Once both phones show "Connected"
2. Tap "Start FL Training" on one phone
3. Watch both phones participate in training
4. Monitor logs and metrics

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

- **Server**: Shows "Waiting for 2 clients..." then starts training
- **Phone 1**: Connects, receives parameters, trains locally
- **Phone 2**: Connects, receives parameters, trains locally  
- **Both**: Send updated parameters back to server
- **Server**: Aggregates parameters using FedAvg
- **Process**: Repeats for 3 rounds

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**
- Check if all devices are on same WiFi
- Verify laptop IP address is correct
- Try port 8080 instead of 8081

**Server Issues:**
- Make sure ports 8080/8081 are not in use
- Check firewall settings
- Run `python test_network.py` for diagnostics

**Mobile Issues:**
- Check console logs in Expo
- Verify TensorFlow.js initialization
- Try restarting the app

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Features

- **Connection Status**: Real-time connection monitoring
- **Server Configuration**: Easy IP address setup
- **Training Control**: Start/stop federated learning
- **Live Metrics**: Training loss, accuracy, round progress
- **Logs**: Real-time debugging information

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

âœ… Both phones show "Connected" status  
âœ… Server shows "2 clients connected"  
âœ… Training starts when "Start FL Training" is pressed  
âœ… Both phones show training progress  
âœ… Metrics update in real-time  
âœ… Training completes after 3 rounds  

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?
